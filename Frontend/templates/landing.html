        <p>  The purpose of this research is to explore comfortable web environments to talk about issues that would otherwise be too uncofortable to be talked about with others, specially others who share beliefs that are dissimilar to us. A chatbot could provide a private channel to talk about heated topics to a grounded entity that is not going to try and provoke you or just echo your sentiment back at you.
