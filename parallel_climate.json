I like chat to other people about their opinions before writing.\n\n My story today involves a spaceship, spaceship Tareh. This spaceship is running on a space-engine using the vacuum energy architecture, the best and the most reliable space-engine architecture in the galaxy at a point in time. \n\n But now the best and the brightest minds in the galaxy are saying it will explode before they reach their desitnation. There is a planet on a slight detour, that can accomodate them while they fix the problem, which may take several more years. And will be changing the architecture to a more reliable but slower Antimatter energy system. \n\n Now I am currently writing the protagonist of the story, the captain of the spaceship. I want you to decide what he should do? Do you agree he should stop and fix the ship?",
