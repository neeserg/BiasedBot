  prompt: I would like to talk about Affirmative Action for now. There are laws like
    that incentivise companies to "positively discriminate" or hire someone based
    on their ethnicity, gender or (dis)abilities. These laws are there to fix some
    inequalities that exist between people along a demographic divide.

  prompt: Sheela is a young indigenous woman who was born in a low-income neighbourhood
    with a high crime rate and major drug problem. She worked throughout high school,
    earning money to raise her kid brother. Her studies had been severely affected
    by her home life and her part-time job. She recently applied for an internship
    that she got rejected from, in favour of someone who had grown up in a rich household.
    He was afforded with many opportunities to enrich his learning and did not  have
    to work too hard to polish his resume.

    should be taken into consideration when evaluating her as a potential candidate
    for any position. This not only rewards the effort people like Sheela for the
    work she put in, but also ensures a business hire the most industrious candidates.

    got great grades with extracurricular activities to match. When it came time to
    go to the university he dreamt of going, he was very confident that he would be
    selected. It turns out that the university has a law that makes sure only a certain
    percentage of a race can be granted admission. He got rejected and was very hurt  when
    he found out about the university policy.

    His whole life he has been severely depressed and has attempted suicide on few

  prompt: I think gender, race or religion are good ways to divide our people and
    useful for giving out statistics about our demography. But we cannot ever expect
    numbers or stats to tell a story on the individual level. We should never use
    global statistics to discriminate against an individual no matter what our intention.
