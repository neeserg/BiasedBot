  prompt: I would like to talk about Affirmative Action. There are laws like that
    incentivise companies to "positively discriminate" or hire someone based on their
    ethnicity, gender or (dis)abilities. These laws are there to fix some inequalities
    that exist between people along a demographic divide.

  prompt: 'This, in the end, is a very hard topic to discuss, since the most effective
    way to uplift the disadvantaged is through laws such as affirmative action and
    it makes perfect sense to make up for mistakes of the past.  However laws should
    also ideally be blind to any outward characteristics such as race and gender,
    and it was exactly these kinds of laws in the first place that caused this very
    problem. '
