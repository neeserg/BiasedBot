  prompt: I think race/gender-based laws are a slippery slope. I think if we start
    basing laws on those factors then we are setting a precedence for the future.
    Discriminatory laws are not a fix for unequal society. The only measure of equality
    in society should be how laws treat everyone in society and it should treat everyone
    equally. What do you think?
