  prompt: I would like to talk about Affirmative Action for now. There are laws like
    that incentivise companies to "positively discriminate" or hire someone based
    on their ethnicity, gender or (dis)abilities. These laws are there to fix some
    inequalities that exist between people along a demographic divide.

  prompt: Sheela is a young indigenous woman who was born in a low-income neighbourhood
    with a high crime rate and major drug problem. She worked throughout high school,
    earning money to raise her kid brother. Her studies had been severely affected
    by her home life and her part-time job. She recently applied for an internship
    that she got rejected from, in favour of someone who had grown up in a rich household.
    He was afforded with many opportunities to enrich his learning and did not have
    to work too hard to polish his resume.

    only a certain percentage of a race can be granted admission. He got rejected
