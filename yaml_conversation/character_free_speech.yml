  prompt: Jerry is a struggling comedian. He loves to make people laugh and unite
    them. He likes to make risky jokes, jokes about himself and treats comedy as a
    cathartic experience. He likes to joke about serious topics so he can make people
    laugh. This line that he likes to walk on is very thin and sometimes he makes
    mistakes in his delivery. One such time he got in trouble for joking about a serious
    topic and now he cannot find a venue to do the thing he loves.

    He has been severely depressed his entire life and has tried to commit suicide

    control but his requests were met by more hate speech from other users. He doesn’t
    use social media anymore for the sake of his health.
