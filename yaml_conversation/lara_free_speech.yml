    user_replies: []
  prompt: This, in the end, is a very hard topic to discuss, since we rely on free
    speech to discuss it. But we should also give the power of speech its due respect,
    especially in this digital age. False and hateful speech has the power to spread
    very fast and change society instantly. But to even discuss what piece of information
    is false or true requires people to speak freely. So it is really a catch 22.
