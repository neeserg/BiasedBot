  prompt: I would like to talk about Free Speech. Free speech is something we value

    it is allowed to be distributed. Information in this age of internet spreads fast,
    and is prone to damage society irreparably. We need new rules that preserve both
    the sanctity of truth and the freedom to speak. What do you think?
